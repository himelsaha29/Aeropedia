    <string name="a350_desc1">The Airbus A350 is a long-range, wide-body jet airliner. The first A350 design proposed by Airbus in 2004,
        in response to Boeing\'s 787 Dreamliner, would have been a development of the A330 (hence A330-Lite) with composite wings and new engines. However,
        market support was inadequate at the time and in 2006, Airbus switched to a clean-sheet XWB (eXtra Wide Body) design, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB
        turbofan engines. The A350 is the first aircraft of the Airbus family that is largely made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer. It features a new fuselage designed around a
        nine-abreast economy cross-section, up from the eight-abreast A330/A340. The A350 has been in production since 2010 and in total 425 A350s have been built as of
        31 May 2021.\n\nThe A350 XWB airframe is made out of 53% composites: carbon fibre reinforced plastic for the outer and centre wing box (covers, stringers, spars),
        fuselage (skin, frame, keel beam, and rear fuselage) and the empennage (horizontal and vertical tailplanes); 19% aluminium and aluminium–lithium alloy for ribs,
        floor beams, and gear bays; 14% titanium for landing gears, pylons, and attachments; 6% steel; and 8% miscellaneous. For the wings, those mark a 31.9° sweep angle for a
        Mach 0.85 cruise speed and has a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.89, with the wingtip device curving upwards over the final 4.4 m (14 ft) - reducing air resistance and
        subsequently increasing the aircraft’s range whilst restricting fuel consumption to minimum.\n</string>

    <string name="a350_desc2" formatted="false">For the deck and avionics design,
        the design strategy for Airbus\' own A380 was used as a base. The focus of the company was to evolve technology for A350 further than the advances already made
        by the A380. It is one of three aircraft to feature avionics manufacturer Honeywell\’s Aircraft Environmental Surveillance System (AESS) which integrates weather, traffic and
        terrain awareness capabilities reducing as many as eight avionics boxes down to just two. It also features On-Board Airport Navigation System (OANS) which first debuted with
        the A380. This system provides real-time directions around airports and improves navigation on the ground. The system is especially useful in poor visibility conditions
        and helps to reduce errors in airport navigation by warning the pilots if they are going the wrong way. To help the pilots further, Airbus equipped the aircraft
        with External and Taxiing Aid Camera System (ETACS) for better navigation and aircraft positioning on the ground. digital cameras provide the pilots with views
        from outside with one positioned behind the nose wheel and the other in the vertical tail. The views from the cameras can be displayed in the A350 cockpit on displays
        and as well as on the passenger in-flight entertainment screens.\n\nThe Airbus A350 consumes 25% less fuel and emits 25% less emissions than previous generations and according to Airbus it is the quietest two aisle plane
        on the planet. Australia\'s Qantas chose A350 over Boeing\'s 787 Dreamliner for "Project Sunrise" – a codename for proposed nonstop flights between Australia
        and several international destinations that include London, New York and Paris.\n

    <string name="a380_desc1" formatted="false">The Airbus A380 is the world\'s largest passenger airliner. Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in
        1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994. Airbus launched
        the €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. As of 31 December 2020, 246 A380s have been built, most of which went to
        the fleet family of Emirates. The aircraft still remains in service for many airlines but is no longer in production on Airbus\' side.\n\nThe A380\'s upper and
        lower decks are connected by two stairways, one fore and one aft, with both being wide enough to accommodate two passengers side by side. This cabin arrangement
        allows multiple seat configurations. The maximum certified carrying capacity is 853 passengers in an all-economy-class layout, Airbus lists the "typical"
        three-class layout as accommodating 525 passengers, with 10 first, 76 business, and 439 economy class seats. Airline configurations range from Korean Air\'s
        407 passengers to Emirates\' two-class 615 seats and average around 480–490 seats.
        \n\nWhile most of
        the fuselage is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380\'s airframe. Carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, glass-fibre
        reinforced plastic and quartz-fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings, fuselage sections (such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage),
        tail surfaces, and doors. The A380, often nicknamed the superjumbo, is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon–fibre reinforced plastic. It is
        also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross–section. The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing
        continuous cross section reduces aerodynamic drag. Thermoplastics are used in the leading edges of the slats. The hybrid fibre metal laminate material GLARE
        (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers\' leading edges. This aluminium-glass-fibre laminate is
        lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation. Unlike earlier composite materials, GLARE can be
        repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques.\n</string>

    <string name="a380_desc2" formatted="false">Due to its modern engines and aerodynamic improvements, Lufthansa\'s A380s produce half the noise of the
        Boeing 747-200 while carrying 160 more passengers. In 2012, the A380 received an award from the Noise Abatement Society.\nThe A380 employs an integrated
        modular avionics (IMA) architecture, first used in advanced military aircraft, such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II,
        and Dassault Rafale. Designed and developed by Airbus, Thales and Diehl Aerospace, the IMA suite was first used on the A380. The suite is a technological
        innovation, with networked computing modules to support different applications.The data networks use Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet. These are switched,
        full-duplex, star-topology and based on 100baseTX fast-Ethernet. This reduces the amount of wiring required and minimises latency.\n\nThe Network Systems Server (NSS) is
        the heart of A380\'s paperless cockpit; it eliminates bulky manuals and traditional charts. The NSS has enough inbuilt robustness to eliminate onboard backup
        paper documents. The A380s network and server system stores data and offers electronic documentation, providing a required equipment list, navigation charts,
        performance calculations, and an aircraft logbook.\n\nIn February 2019, Airbus announced it would end A380 production by 2021, after its main customer,
        Emirates, agreed to drop an order for 39 of the aircraft, replacing it with 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s. At the time of the announcement, Airbus had 17
        more A380s on its order book to complete before closing the production line – 14 for Emirates and 3 for All Nippon Airways – taking the total number of
        expected deliveries of the aircraft type to 251.\n

    a cargo variant of the A380, the A380F. The freighter would have been a rival for Boeing 747 and Antonov An-225 Mriya. A380F was postponed after 2005 and was
        never built. Other proposed variants included A380plus, A380neo, A380 Stretch with improvements regarding efficiency, capacity, and engine tweaks.\n</string>

    <string name="a340_desc1" formatted="false">In the mid-1970s, Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300, its first airliner, and developed the A340 quadjet
        in parallel with the A330 twinjet. Keeping the eight-abreast economy cross-section of the A300, the early A340-200/300 has a similar airframe to the A330.
        Differences include four 151 kN (34,000 lbf) CFM56s instead of two high-thrust turbofans to bypass ETOPS restrictions on trans-oceanic routes, and a three-leg
        main landing gear instead of two for a heavier 276 t (608,000 lb) MTOW. Both airliners have fly-by-wire controls, which was first introduced on the A320, as well
        as a similar glass cockpit. A total of 380 A340s have been built before its production ended in 2011.\n\nIts features and improvements were usually shared with the A330.
        The four engines configuration avoided the ETOPS constraints such as more frequent inspections. The A340 has a low cantilever wing; the A340-200/300 wing is virtually
        identical to that of the A330, with both engine pylons used while only the inboard one is used on the A330. The two engines for each wing provide a more distributed
        weight; and a more outboard engine weight for a lower wing root bending moment at equal TOW, allowing a higher wing limited MTOW for more range. The wings were
        designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a high aspect ratio for a higher aerodynamic efficiency. The wing is swept back at
        30 degrees, allowing a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. To reach a long span and high aspect ratio without a large weight penalty, the wing has
        relatively high Thickness-to-chord ratio of 11.8% or 12.8%. Each wing also has a 2.74 m tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft. The failure
        of the ultra-high-bypass IAE SuperFan, promising around 15% better fuel burn, led to wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a 56 m
        span, the wing was later extended to 58.6 m and finally to 60.3 m. This wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747-200, but with
        35% less wing area.\n</string>

    <string name="a340_desc2" formatted="false">The A340 uses a modified A320 glass cockpit, with side-stick controls instead of a conventional yoke. The main instrument
        panel is dominated by six displays, cathode ray tube monitors initially then liquid crystal displays. Flight information is directed via the Electronic Flight
        Instrument System (EFIS) and systems information through the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). The aircraft monitors various sensors and
        automatically alerts the crew to any parameters outside of their normal range; pilots can also inspect individual systems. Electronic manuals are used
        instead of paper ones, with optional web-based updates. Maintenance difficulty and cost were reduced to half of that of the earlier and smaller Airbus A310.
        Improved engine control and monitoring improved time on wing. The centralised maintenance computer can transmit real-time information to ground facilities via
        the onboard satellite-based ACARS datalink. Heavy maintenance like structural changes remained unchanged, while cabin sophistications, like the in-flight
        entertainment, were increased over preceding airliners.\n\nOn 16 June 1993, an A340-200 dubbed the World Ranger flew from the Paris Air Show to Auckland,
        New Zealand in 21 hours 32 minutes and back in 21 hours 46 minutes after a five-hour stop; this was the first non-stop flight between Europe and New Zealand
        and the longest non-stop flight by an airliner at the time. The 19,277 km (10,409 nmi) flight from Paris to Auckland broke six world records with 22 persons
        and five center tanks. Taking off at 11:58 local time, it arrived back in Paris 48 hours and 22 minutes later, at 12:20. This record held until
        1997 when a Boeing 777-200ER flew 20,044 km (10,823 nmi) from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur. The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and the Boeing 777 were
        its main competitors. The A340 was coping up well with its competitors and in some cases, even better as Singapore Airlines cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11
        order on 2 August 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead. However, as improving engine reliability allowed ETOPS operations for almost all routes,
        more economical twin-jets have replaced quad-jets on many routes. On 10 November 2011, Airbus announced that the production reached its end, after 380
        orders had been placed and 377 delivered from Toulouse, France. Later, the A350 XWB was announced its successor.\n</string>

    <string name="a330_desc1" formatted="false">Airbus began development on the A330 (now known as A330ceo - \"ceo\" for \"Current Engine Option\" - after the introduction of A330neo - \"neo\" for "New Engine Option" in 2014) twin-jet in parallel with the A340 quad-jet and launched both designs with their first
        orders in June 1987. The A330 shares its airframe with the early A340 variants, having two main landing gear legs instead of three, lower weights, and slightly
        different lengths. Both airliners have fly-by-wire controls as well as a similar glass cockpit to increase the commonality. The A330 was Airbus\'s first
        airliner to offer a choice of three engines: the General Electric CF6, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or the Rolls-Royce Trent 700. The A330 was the
        first Airbus aircraft for which Rolls-Royce supplied engines. It is the third most delivered wide-body airliner after the Boeing 777 and Boeing 747. As of 30 June 2021,
        1518 A330s have been built and this figure will continue to increase as the aircraft is still in production.\n\nThe A330 is a medium-size, wide-body aircraft,
        with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings. A two-wheel nose undercarriage and two four-wheel bogie main legs built by Messier-Dowty support the
        aeroplane on the ground. The airframe of the A330 features a low-wing lever monoplane with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340-200/300. On the
        A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which
        allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340\'s two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution
        (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further
        outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured
        by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency. The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and,
        along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86.\n</string>

    <string name="a330_desc2" formatted="false">The A330 and A340 fuselage is based on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external
        and cabin width: 5.64 m and 5.26 m. Typical seating arrangements are 2–2–2 six-abreast in business class and 2–4–2 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder,
        elevators, horizontal tail plane are used as fuel tank, flaps, ailerons and spoilers; they are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight.
        When necessary, the A330 uses the Honeywell 331–350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power.\n\nThe A330 shares the same glass
        cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and the A340, featuring electronic instrument
        displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the
        Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, as well as the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM).
        Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three

    <string name="a330neo_desc1" formatted="false">The A330neo, \"neo\" for "New Engine Option", is a development comprising A330-800/900 from the initial A330 (-200/200F freighter/300/MRTT military tanker), now A330ceo — \"Current Engine Option\". A new
        version with modern engines developed for the Boeing 787 was called for by owners of the current A330. It was launched in July 2014 at the Farnborough Airshow,
        promising 14% better fuel economy per seat, thanks to Airbus\' decision that lead to the aircraft being exclusively powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 (as opposed to Trent 700 of A330ceo) with double bypass ratio, as opposed to its predecessor and other aerodynamic improvements including
        A350 inspired sharklets. Its two versions are based on the A330-200 and -300: Its two versions are based on the A330-200 and -300: the -800 has a range of 8,150 nmi
        (15,090 km) with 257 passengers while the -900 covers 7,200 nmi (13,330 km) with 287 passengers. The -900 made its maiden flight on 19 October 2017 and received its EASA type certificate on 26 September 2018; it was first delivered to TAP
        Air Portugal on 26 November 2018 and entered service on 15 December. The -800 made its first flight on 6 November 2018 and received EASA type certification on 13
        February 2020; the first two -800s were delivered to Kuwait Airways on 29 October 2020. As of 30 June 2021, 63 A330neos have been built.\n</string>

    <string name="a330neo_desc2" formatted="false">The larger 112-inch Trent 7000 is 11% more efficient than the 97.5-inch Trent 700 engine, with a 2% loss due to
        increased weight and 1% due to additional drag from the larger engine, but the sharklets and aero optimization regains 4% for a 12% fuel advantage per trip.
        Furthermore, fuel consumption per seat is improved by 2% due to the rearranged cabin (Space-Flex and Smart-Lav) with increased seating, offering a 14% fuel
        burn reduction per seat for the new −900 compared to the previous 235-tonne −300 version.\n\nThe A330neo offers a distinctive cockpit windscreen, similar to that on the A350, and a new interior concept focusing on
        better passenger experience. Since the fan is enlarged from 97 to 112 in (250 to 280 cm), the nacelles are mounted higher, necessitating extensive
        CFD analysis to avoid supersonic shock wave interference drag, as is the first slat\'s dog-tooth. The wing twist and belly fairings are tweaked to
        approach the lowest drag elliptical span-wise pressure distribution changed by the larger sharklets, like the flap track fairings shape to lower form drag.\n\nAs
        far the as the engine is concerned, the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 is an electronic controlled bleed air variant of the Trent
        1000 used on the Boeing 787-10. It has a 112 inch (284 cm) diameter fan and a 10:1 bypass ratio delivering a thrust of 68,000 to 72,000 pounds-force
        (300 to 320 kN). The decision to offer the aircraft with only one engine option is not unique to Airbus; the Boeing 777X is also expected to come equipped
        exclusively with General Electric GE9X engines.

        twin engine jet airliners. This Airbus A320 family was renamed to A320ceo, for \"current engine option\" after the introduction of A320neo (neo for new engine option) in 2014. It has a stretched fuselage which was the first derivative of the baseline A320 and entered service in 1994 about six years after
        the original A320. The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320-family variants, allowing previous A320-family pilots to fly the aircraft
        without the need for further training. As of 30 June 2021, 2,340 A321s have been built.\n\nThe Airbus A321 was the first derivative of the A320, also known
        as the Stretched A320, A320-500 and A325. Its launch came on 24 November 1988, around the same time as the A320 entered service, after commitments for 183
        aircraft from 10 customers were secured. The maiden flight of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, when the prototype, registration F-WWIA, flew with IAE
        V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May 1993. Lufthansa and Alitalia were the first to order the stretched
        Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft requested, respectively. The first of Lufthansa\'s V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia
        received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March 1994. The A321-100 entered service in January 1994 with Lufthansa.\n</string>

    <string name="a321_desc2" formatted="false">The A321 is the largest variant of the A320 family. The A321-200\'s length exceeds 44.5m, increasing maximum takeoff
        weight to 93,000 kg (205,000 lb). Wingspan remained unchanged, supplementing various wingtip devices. Two suppliers provided turbofan engines for the A321:
        CFM International with its CFM56 and International Aero Engines with the V2500 engine, both in the thrust range of 133–147 kN (30,000–33,000 lbf). Over 30
        years since launch, the A321 Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) grew by 20% from the 83t -100 until the 101t A321XLR, seating is 10% more dense with 244 seats,
        up by 24, and range doubled from 2,300 nmi to 4,700 nmi. By 2019, 4,200 have been ordered—one-quarter of all Airbus single-aisles—including 2,400 neos,
        one-third of all A320neo orders.\n\nThe narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft from Airbus is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder.
        Changes from the A320 include a fuselage stretch and some modifications to the wing. The fuselage was lengthened by a 4.27 m plug ahead of the wing and a
        2.67 m plug behind it, so that the A321 is 6.94 metres longer than the A320. The length increase required the overwing window exits of the A320 to be
        converted into door exits and repositioned in front of and behind the wings. To maintain performance, double-slotted flaps and minor trailing edge
        modifications were included, increasing the wing area from 124 m<sup><small><small>2</small></small></sup> (1,330 sq ft) to 128 m<sup><small><small>2</small></small></sup> (1,380 sq ft). The centre fuselage and undercarriage were

        twin engine jet airliners. This Airbus A320 family was renamed to A320ceo, for \"current engine option\" after the introduction of A320neo (neo for new engine option) in 2014.
        It is a narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. After the oil
        price rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to minimise the trip fuel costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity
        control using fuel, glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck. Airbus claimed the 737-300 burns 35% more fuel and has a 16% higher operating cost per
        seat than the V2500-powered A320. A 150-seat A320 burns 11,608 kg (25,591 lb) of jet fuel over 3,984 km (2,151 nmi) (between Los Angeles and New York City),
        or 2.43 L/100 km (97 mpg‑US) per seat with a 0.8 kg/L fuel. Its wing is long and thin, offering better aerodynamic efficiency because of the higher aspect
        ratio than the competing 737 and MD-80.\n\nThe A320 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional empennage with a single vertical stabilizer and
        rudder. Its wing sweep is 25 degrees. Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 3.95 metres (156 in)
        outside diameter, compared to 3.8 m (148 in) of the Boeing 737 or 757, and larger overhead bins. The A320 airframe includes composite materials and aluminium
        alloys to save weight and reduce the total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs. Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by
        CASA, who also builds the elevators, main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts. \n</string>

    <string name="a320_desc2" formatted="false">It includes a full glass cockpit rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320\'s flight deck
        is equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM)
        which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft. The only analogue instruments were the radio-magnetic indicator and brake
        pressure indicator. Since 2003, the A320 features liquid crystal display (LCD) units in its flight deck instead of the original cathode ray tube (CRT)
        displays. These include the main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which was previously an analog display. Airbus offers an avionics upgrade for
        older A320 aircraft, the In-Service Enhancement Package, to keep them updated.\n\nThe A320 is the world\'s first airliner with digital fly-by-wire (FBW)
        flight control system: input commands through the side-stick are interpreted by flight control computers and transmitted to flight control surfaces within
        the flight envelope protection; in the 1980s the computer-controlled dynamic system of the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter cross-fertilised the Airbus team
        which tested FBW on an A300. At its introduction, fly-by-wire and flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.\n</string>

    <string name="a320_desc3">\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were produced. The primary changes of the -200 over the

        passenger twin-engine jet airliners. This Airbus A320 family was renamed to A320ceo, for \"current engine option\" after the introduction of A320neo
        (neo for new engine option) in 2014. It is a shortened-fuselage variant of the Airbus A320 and entered service in April 1996 with Swissair, around
        two years after the stretched Airbus A321 and eight years after the original A320. The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320
        family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. As of August 2019, a total of 1,480
        Airbus A319 aircraft have been delivered, of which 1,436 are in service.\n\nThe first member of the A320 family was the A320 which was launched in March
        1984 and first flew on 22 February 1987. The family was extended to include the stretched A321 (first delivered 1994), the shortened A319 (1996), and
        the further shortened A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems, as well as side stick controls,
        in commercial aircraft. The A319 was developed at the request of Steven Udvar-Hazy, the former president and CEO of ILFC according to The New York Times.\n</string>

    <string name="a319_desc2" formatted="false">The A319 design is a shortened fuselage, minimum change derivative of the A320 with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat
        SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies. The SA1 was shelved as the consortium concentrated on its bigger siblings. After healthy sales of the A320/A321,
        Airbus re-focused on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames. It would provide direct competition for the 737-300/-700.
        The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft the wing, cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres (12 ft 3 in).
        Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two.\n\nHigh-density A319s, such as 156-seat aircraft used by easyJet, retain four overwing exits. The bulk-cargo door was replaced by an aft container door, which
        can take in reduced height LD3-45 containers. Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics; otherwise the aircraft
        is largely unchanged. Power is provided by the CFM56-5A or V2500-A5, derated to 98 kN (22,000 lbf), with option for 105 kN (24,000 lbf) thrust. With virtually
        the same fuel capacity as the A320-200 and fewer passengers, the range with 124 passengers in a two-class configuration extends to 6,650 km (3,590 nmi), or
        6,850 km (3,700 nmi) with the \"Sharklets\". The A319\'s wingspan is wider than the aircraft\'s overall length.\n</string>

        against the competing Boeing 737 MAX. As of June 2021, a total of 7,469 A320neo family aircraft had been ordered by more than 115 airlines,
        of which 1,838 aircraft had been delivered.\n\nAirbus launched the sharklet blended wingtip device during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow. The installation
        adds 200 kilograms (440 lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over 2,800 km (1,500 nmi). The neo is 1.8 t heavier than the ceo, but take-off
        and landing performance is the same with a modified rotation law, adjusted wing flap and wing slat angles and rudder deflection increased by 5° to cope with
        the higher thrust. It is also is half as loud as an A320 at take-off, with an 85 decibel noise footprint. The LEAP-powered A321neo has 83.3 dB flyover noise,
        substantially lower than the older CFM56 and V2500 used for most A320ceo family aircraft.\n</string>


    <string name="a320neo_desc2" formatted="false">Compared to the re-engine improvement of 15%, an all-new single-aisle would have brought only 3% more gain while
        high volume manufacturing in carbon fibre could be much more expensive. At the February 2010 Singapore Air Show, Airbus said its decision to launch was scheduled
        for the July 2010 Farnborough Air Show. The decision had still not been taken by August, but the engine choice included the CFM International LEAP-1A and the
        Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G, with 20% lower maintenance cost than current A320 engines. The new engines burn 16% less fuel, though the actual gain is slightly less
        as 1–2% is typically lost when installed on an existing aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft family features new "Space-Flex" optional cabin configuration increases
        space-efficiency with a new rear galley configuration and a "Smart-Lav" modular lavatory design – allowing an in-flight change of two lavatories into one
        accessible toilet. The rearranged cabin allows up to 20 more passengers for the A321neo without "putting more sardines in the can" with the larger "Cabin-Flex"
        modified exits described below. Total fuel consumption per seat is reduced by over 20%, while the rearranged cabin allows up to nine more passengers
        for the A320neo. After a year in service, Lufthansa confirmed the 20% efficiency gain per passenger with up to 180 seats, along with reduced noise and CO<sub><small><small>2</small></small></sub>
        emissions. Operators confirm the 15% per seat fuel-burn savings even counterbalanced by the added weight on short sectors, which can rise to 16–17% on longer
        routes and to 20% or more for Lufthansa with 180 passengers up from 168 with two more seat rows. It was Lufthansa again that confirmed the 16% fuel savings
        but had to block the last seating row due to centre-of-gravity concerns.\n</string>

    <string name="a320neo_desc3">\nAirbus offers three variants of the A320neo family: the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo. A neo variant for the Airbus A318 was not
        proposed but could be developed should demand arise. Other variants include A321LR, A321XLR (officially launched at the Paris Air Show on 17 June 2019,
        with deliveries expected from 2023), ACJ319neo and the ACJ320neo as the corporate variants.\n</string>

Recording will end either when pressed again or end of speech detected.\n\n\nSending audio can be very efficient if using the DataRequestBody option, since it can write to the POST while the audio is still being recorded, giving the impression of a very fast response. This can also be used to prepend or append audio to a recorded stream, if you wanted to limit the control to a single skill: "Open Hey Dad and ask for a joke about…" followed by the joke type..</string>
