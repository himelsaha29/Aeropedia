## Take a moment to think about all the aircraft flying at the moment abstracted by the clouds in real life but exposed in the live interactive world map.

# How the live flight tracker works?

The live flight tracker relies on the network created by advanced technologies such as ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€“Broadcast), ASTERIX (All Purpose Structured Eurocontrol Surveillance Information Exchange), and MLAT (Multilateration), and sometimes satellites as well.

The source of the system data is mainly ADS-B which is a relatively new technology under development, which means that today it is rarely used by Air Traffic Control (ATC). According to FlightRadar24, roughly 70% of all commercial passenger aircraft (80% in Europe, 60% in the US) are equipped with an ADS-B transponder. For general aviation this number is probably below 20%. The percentage of aircraft equipped with ADS-B receivers is steadily increasing though, as they will become mandatory for most aircraft around the world in the future. When mandatory, ADS-B will replace primary radar as the primary surveillance method used by ATC.

1. Aircraft gets its location from a GPS navigation source (satellite)
2. The ADS-B transponder on aircraft transmits signal containing the location (flight information and much more)
3. ADS-B signal is picked up by a receiver 

ADS-B data is broadcast every half-second on a 1090MHz, digital data link. ADS-B broadcasts may include:

    Flight Identification (flight number callsign or call sign)
    ICAO 24-bit Aircraft Address (globally unique airframe code)
    Position (latitude/longitude)
    Position integrity/accuracy (GPS horizontal protection limit)
    Barometric and Geometric Altitudes
    Vertical Rate (rate of climb/descent)
    Track Angle and Ground Speed (velocity)
    Emergency indication (when emergency code selected)
    Special position identification (when IDENT selected)
